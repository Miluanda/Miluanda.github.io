            Artist Statement
        </h2>
        <p>
            My artistic practice explores empathy, cultural artifacts, and patterns of microorganisms. I also research bioplastics to establish embodied interactions in medical training, and organize community science projects that decentralize dominant culture in
            knowledge production.
