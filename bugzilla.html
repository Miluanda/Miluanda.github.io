            <i>Bugzilla </i>is a two player interactive retro arcade game. The game explores the mutualistic relationship between treehoppers and ants. In mutualism, each partner species benefits from the other and may fail to grow independently. Each player of Bugzilla takes on a role as an ant or a treehopper. Players venture through the woods protecting each other from predators, discovering sap and avoiding predators until the final destination is reached.

            The cybernetic machine captures the signal of vitals from two fermentation cultures (fermented rice from east Asia and sourdough culture from west north America ) into one sound mix. It mirrors the artist's dual cultural identities that went silent and are seen again through the amplification of weak cultural connections. Sharing the olfaction and graph of life signals, the machine synthesizes differences between the cultures into one sentiment.
            It weaves the intersectionality and microbes' intimacy into meaningful interactions that become the source of affection and empathy.
