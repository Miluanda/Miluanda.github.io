            This research develops of a medical training intervention that utilizes four distinct modalities that build on the practices and processes used in anatomy training and cardiac surgery planning: an interactive screen-based 3D viewer, a 3D printed model
            interaction, an AR interaction, and a VR interaction.

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>As an research study, we collaborated with APIL Lab from University Health Network (UHN) to implement a prototype that enables users to control 3D anatomical model with a physical controller and AR interface through toggling modes, labeling with annotation, and slicing in different planes. We are planning out the user study at the moment. </p>
