        <h5>2022</h5>
        <p>
            <i>Seen for unforeseeable </i>is an interactive installation, a machine that transcribes cultural yeast's biological data (metabolic cycle and yeast strains) into audio and data visualization. This project explores interfaces for domesticated yeast and other microbes to be seen and honors the magic of women's work and their practices of using the kitchen as a bio lab.    </p>
        <p>
            <b>Keywords:</b> Domestication of yeasts, intimacy and mindfulness when interacting with microbes, microbes wisdom, individualism and collectivism, magic of women's work, duality and intersectionality 
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            The cybernetic machine captures the signal of vitals from two fermentation cultures (fermented rice from east Asia and sourdough culture from west north America ) into one sound mix. It mirrors the artist's dual cultural identities that went silent and are seen again through the amplification of weak cultural connections. Sharing the olfaction and graph of life signals, the machine synthesizes differences between the cultures into one sentiment.
            It weaves the intersectionality and microbes' intimacy into meaningful interactions that become the source of affection and empathy.
